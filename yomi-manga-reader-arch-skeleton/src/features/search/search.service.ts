/**
 * features/search — SearchService: query parsing, cursor binding, assembly.
 *
 * Responsibility: the public search contract (FR-SEARCH-001…004) — validate the
 * query, bind the cursor to it, call the repository, and shape SearchHit rows.
 * Ranking lives in the repository (T-SEARCH-001/003); this layer owns everything
 * about the REQUEST.
 *
 * The query
 * ---------
 * `q` is trimmed and must be 1–120 chars. Empty or overlong answers
 * `SEARCH_QUERY_INVALID` (422) BEFORE any query runs — an empty `q` would
 * otherwise reach the repository, which answers "nothing" as its last line of
 * defence, and an overlong one would burn a trigram scan on input nobody typed
 * deliberately. The limit defaults to 24 and clamps to 48 (API_CONTRACT §2.2).
 *
 * The cursor is BOUND TO THE QUERY
 * ---------------------------------
 * The repository's cursor is a position: `{rank, lower_title, id}`. A position
 * is meaningless without the query that minted it — a cursor from `q='naruto'`
 * applied to `q='one piece'` would restart from a rank and title the new result
 * set may not contain, silently returning the wrong page. So the service wraps
 * it: `{v:1, q: <the normalised query>, inner: <repository cursor>}`, base64url,
 * opaque.
 *
 * Three refusals, and they are different failures with different codes:
 * - malformed (not base64url, not JSON, wrong shape) → `CATALOG_PAGE_INVALID`,
 *   the same code every other cursor failure in this app answers. A bad cursor
 *   is a bad position, whatever minted it.
 * - well-formed but minted for a DIFFERENT query → `SEARCH_QUERY_INVALID`. The
 *   cursor may be perfectly good — for its own query — and the defect is in the
 *   (q, cursor) pair, not in either half. Repairing it (restarting from page 1)
 *   would hide a client bug behind plausible-looking results.
 * - `limit` outside 1–48 is CLAMPED, not refused: a limit is a preference, and a
 *   422 for `limit=100` would punish a client for asking politely for too much.
 *
 * The query string is DATA, never SQL (parameterized through SearchRepository;
 * NFR-SEC-015). Rate limiting is the route's job (NFR-SEC-006), not this one's.
 *
 * Requirements: FR-SEARCH-001…004, NFR-SEC-015, ERROR_MODEL §4.
 * Tasks: T-SEARCH-001 (service), T-SEARCH-003 (ranking — owned by the repo).
