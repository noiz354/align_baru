/**
 * DetailUnavailable — the labelled state for "this title's details could not be read".
 *
 * Requirements: NFR-A11Y-003, NFR-SEC-010, ACCESSIBILITY.md §6. Task: T-CATALOG-010.
 *
 * Shares the Cause / what-to-do / where-to-go grammar with the catalog, not-found and error
 * states through the shared StateRegion, so a reader meets the same shape wherever the product
 * has to admit something. The wording is deliberately about the reader's situation — the title
 * is not gone and their place in it is intact — and says nothing about the upstream status.
