/**
 * scripts/seed.mjs — the dev/test seed harness (T-FOUND-012).
 *
 * Authority: TEST_STRATEGY.md §6 ("seed harness (T-FOUND-012) creates
 * deterministic collections … Generated images are synthetic (gradient pages) —
 * this is test data, not product content"), §1 rule 1 (fixtures are created
 * **through the same repositories the app uses**, never hardcoded in features),
 * TASKS.md `T-FOUND-012`, DATA_MODEL.md §1–10 (the rows written here),
 * AGENTS.md §4.2 (requirement + task IDs on every function), §4.3 (fixtures live
 * only in the seed harness) and §4.6 (secrets are env-injected, never in the
 * repository).
 * Requirements: NFR-OPS-002 (typed env at boot, via `loadEnv`),
 * NFR-SEC-009 (no credential in the repository; production is refused),
 * NFR-SEC-015 (parameterized statements only — the Drizzle query builder, never
 * `sql.unsafe`, never a string-built template), NFR-DATA-001 (every row obeys
 * the schema's own constraints), NFR-DATA-002 (the soft-delete axes are never
 * written), NFR-PERF-014 (the harness seeds the 500-page case the reader's
 * window math is built for — reader-behavior.md §15).
 * Tasks: T-FOUND-012 (this file). Consumes: T-FOUND-002 (`loadEnv`),
 * T-FOUND-005 (`createDb` + the Drizzle schema), T-FOUND-006 (migrations are
 * the deploy/boot path's job, NOT this file's), T-FOUND-008 (the pino facade).
 * Tests: `UNIT-SEED-001…005` (tests/unit/seed.harness.test.ts) and
 * `INT-SEED-001…003` (tests/integration/seed.harness.test.ts).
 *
 * The file is plain JavaScript with JSDoc types (like the three gate scripts in
 * this directory) because `npm run seed` runs it as `tsx scripts/seed.mjs`:
 * a `.mjs` extension must stay parseable as JavaScript. `// @ts-check` means
 * `tsc --noEmit` still verifies every statement below against the Drizzle
 * schema, so a renamed column is a compile error, not a runtime surprise.
 *
 * ══ RUN IT ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *   npm run seed -- --env dev
 *   npm run seed -- --env test --run-id ci-7 --load-titles 10000
 * Flags: --env dev|test (REQUIRED), --run-id, --manga, --load-titles,
 *        --page-size WxH, --chunk-size, --timings, --help.
 * Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 unexpected failure · 2 refused (guard/configuration/
 *             credential) · 4 the schema is not migrated.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── PHASE ONE of the two-phase use the task names ──────────────────────────
 * T-FOUND-012 "depends on T-UPLOAD-004 (page asset shape) — runs fully only
 * after the media pipeline exists; before that, seeds DB rows with placeholder
 * asset keys and is re-run after". **T-UPLOAD-004 has not run, so this file is
 * phase one.** Concretely:
 *   - Every `chapter_page.asset_key` and `manga.cover_asset_key` written here is
 *     a PLACEHOLDER handle. The keys are already opaque and deterministic
 *     (FR-MEDIA-003: an unguessable key, never a path), so asset enumeration
 *     behaves like production — but **no object bytes exist in object
 *     storage**, so media delivery for a seeded page 404s until the upload
 *     pipeline can produce the real object.
 *   - The synthetic page images ARE generated (in memory, with sharp) and their
 *     TRUE dimensions and variant byte sizes are recorded on every row
 *     (DATA_MODEL §10 `byte_size_avif|webp|jpeg`, the NFR-PERF-009 record). The
 *     encoded bytes are then dropped: nothing is written to disk or to S3.
 *   - After T-UPLOAD-004 lands, re-running the harness with the real
 *     `commitPages` means: upload the rendered buffers through
 *     `ObjectStoragePort`, take the REAL variant keys the media pipeline mints,
 *     and call `commitPages({ replace: true })` so the old keys are GC-queued
 *     (FR-UPLOAD-009). Until then that step is a no-op and the placeholder keys
 *     are the documented intermediate state.
 *
 * ── Determinism ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two fresh runs produce byte-identical stdout (the report):
 * 1. Titles are numbered — "Seed Manga 0001", "Seed Manga 0030-Pages",
 *    "Seed Manga 0500-Pages" (the task's example, and the two cases
 *    TEST_STRATEGY §6 / reader-behavior.md §15 name).
 * 2. Every primary key is a pure function of the row's natural key
 *    (`deterministicUuid`), so ids do not drift between runs. They are
 *    v7-SHAPED (version/variant nibbles) but deliberately not time-ordered: a
 *    fixture that re-minted its ids on every run could not be diffed.
 * 3. Asset keys are `sha256(slug|chapter|page)` truncated to 32 hex.
 * 4. The seeded page geometry is fixed (480x720 by default).
 * 5. No timestamp, duration, hostname or random value is ever written to the
 *    report. Timings go to stderr through the logger, and the 500-page budget
 *    is reported there (the `< 60 s` edge case of the task).
 * 6. `created_at`/`updated_at` are left to the schema's server-side default and
 *    are NEVER written here, so a re-created row is identical.
 * One thing is deliberately NOT deterministic: the Argon2id hash of a seeded
 * password, because the salt is random. It is written once, on insert, and a
 * re-run can never rewrite it (this writer issues no UPDATE) — a re-hash would
 * invalidate every live session and would make the fixture non-deterministic.
 *
 * ── Idempotency ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "Re-running is safe" is true by construction rather than by a code path: this
 * harness issues INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING and plain SELECTs, and
 * **nothing else** — no UPDATE, no DELETE, no DDL. A fixture writer that can
 * only add rows cannot corrupt a database, cannot resurrect a soft-deleted row
 * and cannot destroy hand-made test data. A row that already exists is counted
 * as existing, not rewritten, so the second run reports zero writes. In
 * `--env test` every public identity (slug, email, alias, asset key) is
 * key-prefixed per run (`--run-id`) so CI jobs cannot collide; in `--env dev`
 * there is no prefix, which is what makes a re-run a pure no-op.
 *
 * ── Repositories, not raw inserts ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * `writeSeedPlan` takes a REPOSITORY BUNDLE as an argument and knows nothing
 * about SQL. `createSeedRepositories(db)` supplies the Drizzle-backed
 * implementation; the unit test supplies an in-memory one. The methods mirror
 * the feature ports the app will use (T-CATALOG-001 / T-AUTH-001):
 *   `users.create`            ← UserRepository.create   (T-AUTH-001)
 *   `manga.create`            ← MangaRepository.create  (T-CATALOG-001)
 *   `chapters.commitChapter`  ← ChapterRepository.create + commitPages
 * The seed-scoped additions, and why each is necessary, are documented on the
 * methods themselves. Two structural notes:
 *   - This file imports NO runtime symbol from `drizzle-orm`: every statement is
 *     reached through the `Db` handle `createDb(env)` returns (boundary rule D2 —
 *     the application owns its SQL; this is a dev tool, not a module of the
 *     app). `drizzle-orm` appears in JSDoc type positions only, which emit no
 *     import at runtime.
 *   - Until T-CATALOG-001 lands the real implementations in
 *     `src/server/db/repositories/`, the harness is their temporary home. That is
 *     the smallest coherent change available inside this task's write scope
 *     (`src/**` is not writable here) and it is recorded as such.
 *
 * ── Boundaries this harness does NOT cross ────────────────────────────────
 *   - It does not run migrations (T-FOUND-006 invariant 3: the app role is
 *     DML-only). It REFUSES with exit 4 when the schema is absent.
 *   - It reads the environment through `loadEnv()` only, never field by field.
 *     The two `SEED_*PASSWORD` names are the single documented exception and
 *     they are read from the SAME source object handed to `loadEnv`, because
 *     DEPLOYMENT.md §3 (T-FOUND-002's normative inventory) has no seed
 *     variables: a spec-question for the document owner, recorded in the
 *     T-FOUND-012 report.
 *   - It writes no product content, ever. Every title, alias, creator name,
 *     synopsis and image is generated here; the genre/tag vocabulary is generic
 *     category words, and the images are gradients computed in memory.
 *   - It refuses `NODE_ENV=production` from BOTH directions — an explicit
 *     `--env production`, and a `production` process env behind a `--env dev`
 *     flag (UNIT-SEED-002). Seeded passwords come from the environment, so a
 *     production DSN would receive a KNOWN credential row: that is the security
 *     control this file exists to enforce, not an afterthought.
