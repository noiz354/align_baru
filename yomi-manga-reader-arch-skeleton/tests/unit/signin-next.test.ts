/**
 * Unit tests — the sign-in `?next=` sanitizer (T-AUTH-012).
 *
 * Canonical plan: TEST_STRATEGY.md §2/§3 has no row for the sign-in page's
 * open-redirect rule — §7 requires a test not in that document to be added
 * to it first, and the document is outside this task's write scope, so the
 * ID below is minted under the task's own naming (the same convention
 * `tests/unit/seed.harness.test.ts` uses for UNIT-SEED-*) and is reported
 * as a spec-question for the document owner.
 *
 * Requirements: FR-AUTH-002, NFR-SEC-005. Task: T-AUTH-012.
 *
 * Why this file exists
 * --------------------
 * After a successful sign-in the page navigates to `?next=`. An unsanitized
 * `next` is an open redirect: `https://evil.example` steals the fresh
 * session the moment the user lands. The rule (from the page's own header)
 * is "same-origin relative paths only" — and it is a pure string function,
 * so it is pinned here rather than behind a browser.
