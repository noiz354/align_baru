/**
 * `setReadStatus` — the branch that used to be a documented no-op
 * (UNIT-LIB-SETREAD, F-008-S1).
 *
 * The defect
 * ----------
 * `setReadStatus(caller, chapterId, false)` read the progress row and wrote
 * `completed: existing.completed` straight back through `saveProgress`. Because
 * `saveProgress` is sticky-OR, that value was always the value already stored, so
 * "mark unread" did nothing — while returning successfully. SQ-LIB-7 recorded it
 * as a known limitation rather than a defect, which is what made it survive: a
 * documented no-op reads as a decision, and nobody re-reads decisions.
 *
 * Why a unit test and not the integration test
 * -------------------------------------------
 * `reader-progress-unset.test.ts` proves the REPOSITORY can clear a flag. This
 * proves the SERVICE asks it to, and — the part the repository test cannot see —
 * that it does NOT reach for `saveProgress` on this path. Both halves are needed:
 * a working `unsetCompleted` nobody calls is the same defect wearing a new name.
 *
 * The fakes are closed-world on purpose. `saveProgress` is stubbed to RECORD and
 * throw on call rather than being omitted, so a regression that re-routes the
 * unset through it fails loudly instead of silently finding a missing method.
 *
 * Requirements: FR-LIBRARY-007, NFR-DATA-003, THREAT T-04
 * Tasks: T-LIB-006
 *
 * No DSN required.
