/**
 * `GET /api/search` (INT-SEARCH-ROUTE, F-011-S2).
 *
 * What this pins
 * --------------
 * The transport around the service: anonymous requests get 200 (not 401),
 * answers are `no-store`, bad input is 4xx, and the 30/min/IP limit answers 429
 * with a `Retry-After` a client can actually use.
 *
 * The service here is a fake, and the fake is shaped by what the route must NOT
 * do with it: the route parses the URL, enforces the budget, and passes the
 * request through. Ranking, binding and shaping are the service's, and are
 * covered in search-service.test.ts and search-repository.test.ts. A test that
 * re-asserted the band order through this route would be testing the fake.
 *
 * The limiter is reset between tests (`resetSearchRateLimit`), because buckets
 * are module state and a suite that leaked them would be order-dependent — the
 * kind of flake that passes alone and fails in the full run.
 *
 * Requirements: FR-SEARCH-001…004, NFR-SEC-006, API_CONTRACT §2.2
 * Tasks: T-SEARCH-003, T-SEARCH-005
 *
 * No DSN required.
