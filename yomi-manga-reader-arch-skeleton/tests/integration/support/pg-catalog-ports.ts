/**
 * Integration-test support — a REAL PostgreSQL 18 database plus port doubles
 * backed by it, for the T-CATALOG-002 / T-CATALOG-007 suites.
 *
 * ── Why doubles and not the product repositories ─────────────────────────
 * `server/db/repositories/**` (T-CATALOG-001) is a CONCURRENT lane and is not
 * part of this task's write scope. These doubles are written against the PORT
 * INTERFACES — `MangaRepository`, `ChapterRepository`, `CatalogVocabularyPort`
 * — which are the contract (dependency-rules.md §2). They are faithful rather
 * than convenient: real SQL against the real `manga`/`chapter`/`genre` schema,
 * so ordering, the `numeric(8,2)` number form, the visibility rule and the
 * 1000-cap are exercised against rows instead of a mock. When the product
 * repositories land, the only change these suites need is which object is
 * passed in.
 *
 * The latest-chapter read is a correlated subquery in the SELECT list of ONE
 * statement, which is what `MangaRepository.list`'s contract demands
 * (NFR-PERF-004; data-flow.md §1: "latestChapter is computed in the repository
 * query (single SQL, no N+1)"). `SqlProbe` counts the statements the driver
 * actually sent, so a regression to an N+1 fan-out is a test failure rather
 * than a comment — and `N_PLUS_ONE_CONTROL` in the suite runs the same rows
 * through a deliberately per-manga implementation to prove the probe can see
 * an N+1 at all.
 *
 * ── Not product data (AGENTS.md §4.3, TEST_STRATEGY §6) ──────────────────
 * Every row is a numbered synthetic fixture created here, in test code. Ids
 * come from the product seed harness's `deterministicUuid`, so a fixture id and
 * the harness's id for the same key are the same value and a failing row stays
 * traceable without inventing an identity scheme.
 *
 * DSN: `DATABASE_URL`. The suites SKIP when it is absent. `openCatalogDatabase`
 * drops and recreates the `public` schema, so the DSN MUST be a throwaway
 * database. Do not point two suites at the same one — vitest.config.ts runs
 * every integration file in ONE fork.

 * Opens a throwaway DATABASE for ONE suite, dropped and re-migrated.
 *
 * ── Why a database per suite, and not a shared one ───────────────────────
 * Two independent reasons, both measured rather than assumed:
 *
 * 1. The suites run in PARALLEL. `vitest.config.ts` sets
 *    `poolOptions.forks.singleFork`, and Vitest 4 REMOVED `poolOptions` (it
 *    warns "test.poolOptions was removed in Vitest 4 — all previous poolOptions
 *    are now top-level options"), so the setting is inert: every integration
 *    FILE gets its own fork and they overlap. Four files that each ran
 *    `drop schema public cascade` destroyed one another's fixtures, and the
 *    failures surfaced as duplicate-key errors in unrelated code.
 * 2. A per-suite SCHEMA is not enough on its own. `migrateOnBoot`/`runMigrations`
 *    keep their journal in `public.__drizzle_migrations` by name
 *    (`MIGRATION_JOURNAL_SCHEMA`), so a second suite pointed at a fresh schema
 *    reads that journal, concludes every migration is already applied, and
 *    creates no tables at all. The journal is per-DATABASE, not per-schema.
 *
 * The fix for (1) belongs in `vitest.config.ts` (a top-level `singleFork`),
 * which is outside this task's write scope, so each suite takes a database of
 * its own instead. That makes the files independently runnable AND
 * parallel-safe against one `DATABASE_URL` — automating exactly what the
 * existing suites' headers ask operators to do by hand with separate databases
 * and separate ports.
 *
 * The drop/create pair runs under an advisory lock: two files naming the same
 * database (a re-run, or a typo) serialise instead of racing, and
 * `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS` is not otherwise concurrency-safe.
 *
 * @param databaseUrl the operator's DSN (`DATABASE_URL`)
 * @param name this suite's own database name
