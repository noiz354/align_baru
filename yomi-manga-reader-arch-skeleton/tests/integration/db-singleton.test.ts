/**
 * One pool per process (F-001-S1).
 *
 * What this closes
 * ----------------
 * A single members' request could hold THREE pools: two composition roots each
 * called `createDb` independently, and `server/auth/guard.ts` opened and closed a
 * third per call. DEPLOYMENT.md §1 budgets the app 10 connections, so a third of
 * the budget was spent before any work happened. Nothing tested this, because
 * "the code calls a function" and "there is one pool" are different claims and
 * only the second one is a property.
 *
 * So this counts. Object identity IS the count: a pool is the driver client
 * object, so two acquisitions returning the same handle means one pool was
 * opened. A test that merely observed the calls would pass against a
 * non-memoised implementation, which is the mistake the `NEXT EXECUTABLE TASK`
 * in MASTER_PLAN.md warns about.
 *
 * Requirements: NFR-OPS-002, NFR-PERF-014
 * Tasks: T-FOUND-005, T-AUTH-007 (the third connection is fixed in F-001-S2)
 *
 * DSN: `DATABASE_URL`; SKIPS without it.
