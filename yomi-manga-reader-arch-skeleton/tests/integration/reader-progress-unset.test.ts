/**
 * `unsetCompleted` — the operation that did not exist (INT-PROG-UNSET, F-008-S1).
 *
 * The defect
 * ----------
 * `LibraryService.setReadStatus(false)` read the progress row and wrote
 * `completed: existing.completed` straight back through `saveProgress`. Since
 * `saveProgress` is sticky-OR by contract (`SET completed =
 * reading_progress.completed OR excluded.completed`), the value written back was
 * the value already stored: a guaranteed no-op, documented as SQ-LIB-7 so it read
 * as a decision. A caller could not tell "marked unread" from "nothing happened",
 * which is the difference between a feature and a lie.
 *
 * These tests are written against the REAL repository, not a mock of it. The whole
 * defect lived in SQL that a mock cannot express: whether an `UPDATE ... WHERE`
 * can clear a flag a `DO UPDATE SET ... OR` structurally cannot, and whether a
 * second chapter-level read is needed at all.
 *
 * What is NOT covered: the route. No `read=false` route exists until F-005 lands
 * a guard — the auth deferral is why this is service-and-repository-only.
 *
 * Requirements: FR-LIBRARY-006, NFR-DATA-003, THREAT T-04, THREAT T-18
 * Tasks: T-LIB-006, T-READER-021
 *
 * Needs DATABASE_URL. Skips cleanly without it, like every other DB test here.
