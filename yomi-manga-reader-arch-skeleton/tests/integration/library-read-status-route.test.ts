/**
 * `POST /api/library/chapters/{chapterId}/read-status` (INT-LIB-READSTATUS,
 * F-008-S1).
 *
 * What this pins
 * --------------
 * The route is the thing that turns `unsetCompleted` from a correct operation into
 * a reachable one. Before this slice `setReadStatus` had been complete, wired to
 * two ports, and called by nothing — so the only place its behaviour had ever been
 * observed was a no-op that a comment described (SQ-LIB-7).
 *
 * The tests here are about the EDGE, because the edge is where this route can
 * hurt someone:
 * - `read` must be a real boolean. `Boolean('false')` is `true` and
 *   `Boolean(0)` is `false`, so a coercing parse would let `{"read": 0}` mark a
 *   chapter READ — the opposite of what the caller meant, and irreversible
 *   without another call.
 * - a body of `{}` is "the caller sent nothing", which is not "mark it unread".
 * - the acting user is the session's, and a body cannot name another reader.
 * - an unpublished chapter is a 404, not a probe.
 *
 * What is NOT covered: the `/library` page's control. That is deferred with
 * F-005 (page-level guards), and this route is the members' `/api` lane, which
 * already ships and enforces membership per route.
 *
 * Requirements: FR-LIBRARY-007, API_CONTRACT §1/§2.4, THREAT T-04
 * Tasks: T-LIB-006, T-LIB-007
 *
 * No DSN required: the service is a fake, so nothing connects anywhere.
